# DAI-AdaptiveCruiseControl
This repository contains the code of our CARLA Adaptive Cruise Control project for I-Distributed Artificial Intelligence.

This branch contains the object detection training and test of the traffic signs models and its implementation with the vehicle detection. Its final version is merged in the ComputerVisionTest branch.
