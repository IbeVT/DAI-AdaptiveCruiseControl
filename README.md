# Adaptive cruise control
This repository contains the code of our CARLA Adaptive Cruise Control project for I-Distributed Artificial Intelligence.

Currently, there are only parts of the code, seperated in multiple branches as follows:

| Branch | Content | Creator |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| RL | Attempt to create a RL agent | Stijn |
| ComputerVision | Attempt to retrieve the sensor info from Carla and make predictions to feed to the RL agent | Ibe |
| ComputerVisionTest | Testing integration between ComputerVision and Sensors | Ibe |
| Sensors | Configuring sensors with carla PythonAPI.  | Lukas |
| Yolo | First experiments with and training of the YOLOv8 model | Ibe |
| Dataset-setup | Gathering data and training the YOLOv8 model | Alberto & Mar√≠a |
| traffic-signs | Training YOLOv8 model on traffic sign recognition & inplementation in Carla | Maria |
